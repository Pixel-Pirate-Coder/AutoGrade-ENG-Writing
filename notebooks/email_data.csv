"Dear Ronny, I was glad to hear from you again. Actually, summer in Russia is quite hot and dry, though it depends on certain region. To be honest, my favourite season is winter because this time is associated with Christmas 37 81 and New Year. If my parents allowed me to visit Australia I would be happy to spend my next summer in this exotic country. Having written about the upcoming visit of your uncle, you made me curios. What is the profession of your uncle? Has he got any hobbies? Is he going to visit some museums or theatres within his staying, or not? Regretfully, I’ve got to finish my letter. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best wishes, Denis",1.0,2.0,2.0,5

"Hello, Philippa!
Thanks for your letter. I'm happy to hear from you.
In your letter you asked me about travelling by air. Actually, it never scares me. I always was more exited about travelling itself, maybe it helps me. But headache is often come after flight, it's the main problem. I know that some people have problems with sleep in plain, but I don't, so flight is pretty easy for me.
If we talk about what I prefer as way of travelling, then it would be train. Yes, there is some minuses. For example, this way of travelling is not as fast as flight, but the view from the window and sound of train's mechanism is very pleasant. Atmosphere can't be compared to anything else.

"Hi Anna!
I was so glad to hear you again! In your lettast letter you asked me about my language. I will tell you.
I think that some Russian know English well, because many children started study English from the 2nd grade in school. And many students have exam. Speaking about the best way to learn foreign languages, I think, is watch films and listen music on this language because
you need to used to how the language sounds. So, that's all. 
What about you? What do you think about the best way to learn foreign language? Are you going to visit French or Italy on the next summer? Write to me soon!

Thanks for your email, I was happy to get it!
In your letter you've asked me about animal protection. Well, there are lots of endangered animals in Russia, for example Amur tigers. Personally, I think that helping animals is really important because animals are our little friends and we have to protect those who are struggling or in danger.
I believe that the best thing people can do to help endangered animals is to make donations to special organisations which help to protect endangered species.

Thank you for your email! It's good to hear from you. Sorry, I wasn't able to write back earlier because I was busy with exams.
Now I can answer your questions I've always wanted to try ecotourism, but sadly it's not popular in Russia. I think it's due to people's indifference towards nature. Ecotourism can offer a lot of opportunities such as seeing wildlife while not harming the forests.
By the way, you've mentioned returning from a youth camp. How long did you stay there? Where is it located? What activities does it offer?

I'm glad to get your email! Sorry for not writing so long. I was busy with my homework. 
Thank you for asking such interesting questions! I'll answer them with pleasure. Answering the first question, of course, there are some endangered animals in Russia. The Amursky tiger is known to be one of the most well-known examples. Personally, I consider helping animals highly important because humans are responsible for maintaining lives of other creatures as our intellect is better developed. In my opinion, people can do a number of things to help endangered species. Attracting society's attention by organising some meetings is one of them.

You asked me some questions about ecotourism, so let me answer them. As for me, I find ecotourism really interesting, because it shows people how to travel without making a harm for the nature. I think that ecotourism isn't so popular in Russia now, because we don't have many companies who can propose that. You also asked me about new opportunities which ecotourism does. To my mind, ecotourism helps to save our planet clean and it shows new ways of travelling.

We just stand next to each other and then start talking as if we were already friends. I have some friends online ether, but I prefer real chatting instead, because it is more humane. I can feel a person's mood and see his emotions, it seems important to me. 
 
 You've mentioned your sister's wedding. What style does she want to have her wedding in? How many guests did she and her groom invite? Has she already chosen her wedding dress?

 Thank you for your recent letter. I was very glad to hear from you again!
 
 You asked me about grandparents. Unfortunately, not all my grandparents are alive. Now I have an amusing grandad and a kind-hearted grandma. My grandad lives in Ryazan and my grandma lives in Ukraine, in Kiev. Well, I rarely visit my grandparents but I always try to help them even we are not together. For instance, I help them sort out their phone or find information my grandparents need. 
 
 By the way, I’d like to ask you some questions about your granny’s biscuits. What was the flavour of biscuits? How long does it take to bake them? What flour is needed?

"Hi, Mark, 
Thank you for your recent email. I'm glad to hear from you again. Sorry, I haven't answered earlier because I was busy with my school.
I will be glad to answer, all the questions you asked me in your email. Honestly, unlike you I adore helping my mum. I think family members should share domestic responsibilities equally. As for your second question, I help my parents to cook meals, do the shopping and mop the floor during the week. Answering your third question, my least favourite household chore is to iron the clothes. I don't like doing it because it's very time-wasting.
Anyway, please, tell me more about your father's lawnmower. What colour. is it? Is the lawnmower big or small? How much does it cost?
Sorry, I'd better go now. Let's keep in touch.

Talking about me — I’m not sure yet. I like foreign languages, different cultures, but I don’t think a professor's job is something for me. I’d like to choose a job that'd give me a possibility of traveling, meeting new people, communicating with them in their language, because that’s what I’m interested in. As for my parents, they seem to be OK with it.Anyway, you've mentioned travelling. Have you decided when you are going to go? What countries would you like to visit?

"Dear Ted,Thank you for your message. Sorry, I couldn’t answer you earlier.It's great that you've joined to the science camp. But here definitely exist summer youth camps, earlier called Pioner’s camps. There are camps of different types: sportive, with language schools and others. Nowadays they are not very popular with teenagers but a lot of parents still send their kids in there, because it’s a variant of passing summer far from city for them. I was in the summer camp once and it was awful! Actually I have problems with getting along with new people so during the whole time in there I was an outsider. Anyway, you've mentioned your brother. What university did your brother enter to? What specialization will he choose? Is this university in your town or away from it?

"Dear Jane,Thanks for your message. Sorry, I couldn’t answer you earlier.I like different films. I have a favorite director who works in the different genres. His movies have something from comedies, from dramas, from horror-stories and musicals. I should say that I definitely prefer watching movies it the cinema, because a film seen on a wide screen with a good sound makes way more impressions that one watched at home on a small screen. I don’t think that it’s that necessary to read a book before watching the film. It’s possible to enjoy a movie based on a book without comparing it with the original. Anyway, you've mentioned your trip. How was it, by the way? Did you travel with your family or friends?

"Dear Mike,Thanks for your message. I'm sorry for not writing you for so long. I was busy doing my school project. I’m sure you’ll present your project successfully. My only advice is to keep calm and do your best. Some teachers ask us to do creative projects connected with their subjects. But it’s not usually our main work. We do it before the exams to obtain the better marks at the end of the course. I like to do oral presentations, actually. I think that I can present my theme better in the oral conversation by telling the information in the accessible way with some interesting facts and an opportunity of starting discussions. Anyway, good for your brother! Did he like that he was in the target group of the experiment? How did he feel? Is he interested in the results?I've got to go as my father is asking me to help him with his car.Write back soon.Best wishes,Mike",2.0,2.0,2.0,6
"Dear Lisa,Thanks for your message. I'm sorry for not writing you for so long. I was helping my brother with his school tasks. It’s great that the administration of your school ask students about their preferences. In Russia many schools have uniforms, but not all of them. In my school we never had it. Every student has an opportunity to wear what he wants and self-affirm himself by his style. I would like to invent something middle official and more comfortable. It could be same for boys and girls, because I believe that it’s not very comfortable to wear skirts all the time. Anyway, you've mentioned an exchange school program.

My family used to spend a lot of time together but since my dad changed his job we can’t do it anymore that frequently as we did. He is always very busy. Still, we anyway go out of town and spend some time together in the countryside every month. I like those small journeys very much. But unfortunately as in England we also have some weather problems. In the morning it’s shiny and two hours later it begins to rain. Anyway, you've mentioned a contest. Is it local? Who won the first prize?

"Dear David,Thanks for your message. You are welcome. It was a pleasure for me to send you the material.I think that the education in the Russia of Tsar was way much better than now. And, speaking even wider, the cultural level was much upper. Every family of a high society spoke French at home, not Russian, so it was normal that kids knew it before they went to Lyceum. And what is more, they have governesses that gave them a good home education. I’d like to study in a boarding school like Pushkin’s Lyceum because it’s a privileged education, I guess.Anyway, you mentioned applying to the university. To which university are you applying?

I also heard that in the Eastern part of Russia, pupils also have classes of Japanese and Chinese. I like learning languages, because I do it quite well. I enjoy going grammar exercises and speaking tasks. I think that I will definitely use languages in my future career, I’d like to work in the international company.Anyway, I'm glad that you got elected. What does the school Government do?

Speaking of me, when I was little, my class used to go to the museum each week and it was very interesting. In general, I think that museums are very important for cultural education, but it shouldn’t be given as an obligatory thing. Now we go to the museums twice a year and our teacher gave us possibility to choose which museum we want to visit. My favorite is the museum of photography.Anyway, you've mentioned holidays.

When we have family gatherings we usually spend them at home, because our apartment is pretty big and it can accommodate many people at the same time. I usually help my mom to cover the table and to cook a holyday meal. She prepares some meat and garner, salads, and a holyday sweet cake. There is no need to entertain guests in a special way, we just talk about what happens in our lives and that’s all. What's your middle brother's name? How long ago did he take up tennis?

"Dear Nick,Thanks for your message. I'm sorry for not writing you for so long. I was preparing to the school performance.Of course I can help you with your project! I think that the amount of reading depends a lot on a familiar education. But in general young people read less than adults in Russia. I think that I read more than my friends. I‘m reading every day before going to sleep and I read books in the public transport and traffic jams. I prefer traditional books because my family has a big home library.

"Dear Robert,Thanks for your message. I'm sorry for not writing you for so long. I was helping my dad with his car. My city is pretty big and it changes a lot and quite recent: new buildings and streets appear, even new areas. For example this summer our government built a new opera theater in the center. Many people were criticizing it for its modern view. They were saying that it looks awful next to the old opera building which is near. I agree with them. I think that in the historical center isn’t appropriate to build such edifices. Send my congratulation to your mum. Does she love cooking? What dish did your mother cook?

Like any other family we have some chores, such as cleaning, preparing food, buying it, cleaning the pets toilets etc. if I had to cook for myself I would try to make a pizza or a pie. I think that any boy should be able to cook and keep house, because this is a universal knowledge. I think that the opinion about dividing girl’s and boy’s responsibilities is stupid and not more than a prejudice.Anyway, you've mentioned going to hike with your friends. Where are you going to?

"Dear Nancy,Thank you for your last letter and I'm sorry I couldn't answer you earlier.Actually, I'm extremely interested in dreams. I even read a book of Freud about dreams and their meanings. I think that the tipe olf dreams are directly conected with the mental state and the state of the organism in general. Sometimes I have dreams every night, sometimes they don't appear for months. Also there is a big variety of themes. My dreams can be bright and fairytale-like or they can be very realistic. I usually forget all my dreams as soon as i wake up, so I can't be sure whether any of them ever came true.Anyway, you've mentioned a trip. How was your visit to a toy museum?

Actually I know a girl who worked there this winter. It wasn't her first experience in organizing a sport event, because it's her specialization in University. I would like to be on reception, to help visitors and answer their questions. I would choose this kind of volunteer activities because I know foreign languages.Anyway, you mentioned your mom.

But here we don’t have any volcanoes, but there is another risk to suffer from fire, I’m talking about wildfires. Many Russian woods were destroyed by it during the last summer seasons. All we can do is not leaving trash in the forests and don’t smoke and leave unquenched butts there. Anyway, you've mentioned your teacher. How old is your teacher? Is it her first award?

I think it’s amazing sport, though it’s full of extreme. In fact I don’t completely support extreme sports, because I don’t like fear and I care a lot about my security.

It helps me to relax after a tough day and all my friends just love to receive my postcards! As for themselves, most of them do mountain biking as a hobby. I think that the most expensive hobbies are connected with travelling and sports, because plane tickets and hotels are expensive. And some sport equipment can be expensive too. In general, people need hobbies to express themselves in their own way. Sometimes people also trying to find hobbies to communicate with other people who are interested in the same things.Anyway, you've mentioned your room. Did you change your room completely?

I think it is very hard to take part in high level events here in Russia, because you need to show your professionalism and work really hard.

If somebody organized a costume party I would choose a costume of some hero from old console games like Dandy or Sega, because I’m a big their fan. Wearing a Pacman suit would be legendary. And of course making this kind of things by yourself is better because the result is more unique and matters much more for you. I love costume parties.

There's always a way to have fun, you know. That is the reason I like summer the most of all seasons, by the way: rainy or not, it is still a lot of continious free time.

The last natural phenomenon to impress me a lot was the polar day I experienced last summer while visiting the Solovetsky islands. Funny, but mostly it felt sleepy, since I was completely knocked off my sleeping routine by continious daylight within 4 days.Horse riding must be an awesome sport.

"Hi Ronny!

Thank you for your message. I was very glad to receive it.

I agree with you, summer is good because of a long holiday. Unfortunately, the weather is very changeable in Russia in summer. It can be hot and sunny or cold and rainy. However, I like summer best of all because it is the warmest and most beautiful season. This summer I'm planning to visit my grandparents, they live in Vladivostok and we meet each other very seldom.

By the way, you've mentioned your uncle Keith is coming to visit you next week. Where does he live? Is he on holiday now? How long is he going to stay with you?

I have to go now. Write back soon.

"Dear Cathleen,

Thanks for your letter. I’m always happy to hear from you. It's great that you are preparing for Halloween!

In your letter you ask me about holidays and festivals we have in Russia. Of course in my country people celebrate lots of holidays and fun festivals, for example, New Year, Victory Day and Maslenitsa. As for me, My favourite one is Maslenitsa as it is the end of winter and the begininng of spring. Also, it is very sunny festival, my mother usually makes pancakes during all this week. On Sunday my family and I always go to the fairy and have fun.

By the way, it's great that your pumpkin was voted the best in the neighbourhood. Was it really big? What was it decorated with? Did you grow it or buy?

That's all for now. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for your e-mail. I’m always happy to hear from you. It's awful that you got wet going to school that day!

In your letter you ask me about bad weather. As for me, once I had to go to school when it was stormy, there was a strong wind outside. It was terrible weather to walk. Actually, Russian schools are closed when it is too cold, about 30 degrees below zero. But it doesn’t happen very often, I missed school three or four times because of bad weather.

By the way, it's great that you’ve bought ice-skates. Are your ice-skates for beginners? What colour are they? Are they comfortable?

That's all for now. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for your e-mail. I’m always happy to hear from you.

It's great that you had an international cuisine day in your school cafeteria! Well, let me tell you about my school cafeteria. So, traditional soups, salads, meat and fish dishes with rice or pasta are usually served in my school cafeteria. They are quite tasty and cheap. However, I prefer brining my lunch from home as I'm a vegetarian. Also, it saves my time because I don't have to stand in a line. Moreover, our lunch break is only twenty minutes.

By the way, it's great that you’ve started doing yoga. Is your yoga teacher young? Has he/she got any certificates? Is he/she nice?

That's all for now. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for your e-mail. I’m always happy to hear from you.

It's great that you had gone to a book festival! As for me, I have never been to such events but I love reading. The last book I’ve read was a novel about sea adventures. It was very interesting. However, I have to read classical novels for my literature classes. That is why I don’t have much time for reading books I really like. In general, I spend few hours reading books for pleasure at weekends.

Anyway, you’ve mentioned an interesting film in Spanish you saw last week. What film genre was it? What’s the film cast? Who’s the director?

That's all for now. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for your letter. I’m always happy to hear from you. It's great that you have finally taught your parrot to say a greeting!

In your letter you ask me about extreme sports. Personally, I find them thrilling. However, I think one has to be over 21 years of age to be allowed to do extreme sports as they are really dangerous. As far as I know, the most popular extreme sports in Russia are urban climbing, cave diving and rope jumping.

I'd like to ask you some questions about your parrot. What is its name? How old is it? What colour is it?

That's all for now. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for your recent message and I'm sorry I couldn't answer you earlier.
In your email you asked me about ecotourism. I have a positive attitude towards ecotourism and I think it is very important. Ecotourism is quite popular in Russia. The reason is that my country has a wide range of natural areas that need to be protected and taken care of. Ecotourism offers new opportunities such as camping, hiking, visiting various places and learning more about ecology.
Anyway, you've mentioned a youth camp. How long did you spend there? Did you go there alone or with friends? What activity did you enjoy

Thank you for your email. I hope you're OK. In your message you asked me some questions about ecotourism. Well, I like ecotourism very much and I think it is a great way to spend holidays. Ecotourism is not popular in my country because Russians prefer to spend their holidays at home with their families playing games and watching TV. In my opinion, ecotourism offers a lot of new opportunities: spending free time on fresh air, relaxing by enjoying natural beauty and bringing people together.

Thank you for your e-mail. I'm very glad to hear from you.
Well, I believe ecotourism is an amazing idea to spend holidays. In my opinion, it helps people to see how wonderful the world around them is. Ecotourism is quite popular in my country because there're a lot of unique forests, rivers and lakes in Russia. Ecotourism offers the opportunity to learn about the climate of the area where people travel, about animals and plants of this place, which is new for tourism.

"Hi George,
Thanks for writing to me. It's great to hear from you.
In your email you asked me about ecotourism. Well, I'm glad it's becoming
more popular nowadays, because I believe it's very important to take care of the environment even when on holidays. Eco-friendly tourism is common in Russia. That's probably because the recent natural disasters like forest fire have made people pay more attention to nature and wildlife. One of the things that make ecotourism so cool is the opportunity to choose exciting means of transport like bicycles and rowboats. 
Tell me more about the youth camp. How long have you been there? Did it offer leadership classes? What facilities for pasttime did it provide?

I'll answer your questions about holidays with pleasure. Well, most of the time I spend summer holidays with my friends.

I hope you enjoyed your trip to the zoo. I like going to zoo because I love animals. Unfortunately, a lot of them are endangered. For example, Siberian Tiger and Snow Leopard are endangered in Russia. I think helping animals is very important because they are a part of our lives.

to save these animals.
